**About the project**

<p style='text-indent:40px;'>
This is my portfolio which is already online at https://fullstacker.com.br. Some libraries were used to create the carousels: React-responsive-carousel and React-Multi-Carousel.
</p>

**The use os web scapers**

<p style='text-indent:40px;'>
The articles here presented were all written at Linkedin but to get all the data for the thumbnails, a web scrapper had to be developed since Linkedin doesn't have an API to do it. It's important to say that only MY PUBLIC content is being fetched.
